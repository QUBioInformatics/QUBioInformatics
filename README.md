# Bio Informatics Clubs 
### A student-run club at Queen's University that emphasizes the interplay between computing and biological sciences. Students from life sciences, biology, and computing programs work together to apply skills to solve real-life scientific problems. Through workshops and journal clubs, members expand their knowledge of the field of scientific research, learn computing languages commonly used in research, and build meaningful inter-faculty relationships.
